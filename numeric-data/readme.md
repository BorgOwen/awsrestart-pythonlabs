# Working with Numeric Data Types

## Lab Overview

Python makes it easier to work with math. Itâ€™s one of the most popular languages among data scientists who analyze large amounts of data. In this lab, youâ€™ll explore the basic data types used to store numeric values.

### What you will learn

* Using the Python shell
* Working with the `int` data type
* Working with the `float` data type
* Working with the `complex` data type
* Working with the `bool` data type

**Estimated completion time:** 60 minutes

## Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll use the **AWS Cloud9 IDE** for this lab.

1. Start the lab environment and wait until you see **Lab status: ready**.
2. In the AWS Console, open **Cloud9** and choose your environment (`reStart-python-cloud9`).
3. Open the IDE and dismiss any pop-ups.

---

## Steps

### 1. Create Your Python Exercise File

* In Cloud9, go to **File > New From Template > Python File**.
* Save it as `numeric-data.py` in `/home/ec2-user/environment`.

---

### 2. Open the Terminal

* Open a new terminal in Cloud9.
* Confirm youâ€™re in `/home/ec2-user/environment` with:

  ```bash
  pwd
  ```

### 3. Exercise 1: Using the Python Shell

Start Python:

```bash
python3
```

Try basic math:

```python
2 + 2    # Output: 4
4 - 2    # Output: 2
2 * 2    # Output: 4
4 / 2    # Output: 2.0
```

Exit the shell with:

```python
quit()
```

---

### 4. Exercise 2: `int` Data Type

Edit your file:

```python
print("Python has three numeric types: int, float, and complex")

myValue = 1
print(myValue)
print(type(myValue))
print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))
```

Run it:

```bash
python3 numeric-data.py
```

---

### 5. Exercise 3: `float` Data Type

```python
myValue = 3.14
print(myValue)
print(type(myValue))
print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))
```

---

### 6. Exercise 4: `complex` Data Type

```python
myValue = 5j
print(myValue)
print(type(myValue))
print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))
```

---

### 7. Exercise 5: `bool` Data Type

```python
myValue = True
print(myValue)
print(type(myValue))
print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))

myValue = False
print(myValue)
print(type(myValue))
print(str(myValue) + " is of the data type " + str(type(myValue)))
```

---

## Expected Output (Sample)

```
Python has three numeric types: int, float, and complex
1
<class 'int'>
1 is of the data type <class 'int'>
3.14
<class 'float'>
3.14 is of the data type <class 'float'>
5j
<class 'complex'>
5j is of the data type <class 'complex'>
True
<class 'bool'>
True is of the data type <class 'bool'>
False
<class 'bool'>
False is of the data type <class 'bool'>
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Completion

You have learned about Pythonâ€™s three numeric data types: **int, float, complex**, and the additional **bool** type.
